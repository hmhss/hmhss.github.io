              Hebron Matriculation Higher Secondary School was founded in <strong>1986</strong> by <strong>Prof. S. Johnson</strong> and <strong>Prof. Angel Johnson</strong> with a clear educational vision rooted in values, discipline, and holistic development. From its inception, the founders believed that education should extend beyond academic instruction to encompass character formation, moral integrity, and the overall intellectual, social, and emotional development of children.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Prof. S. Johnson was particularly committed to instilling strong ethical values and life skills in students, emphasizing that true education prepares young minds not only for examinations, but also for responsible citizenship and lifelong learning. This guiding philosophy continues to shape the school’s academic and co-curricular approach.
