You are a senior full-stack web engineer. Build a **production-ready, GitHub Pages–hosted** school website for:

**Hebron Matriculation Higher Secondary School**  
Nagercoil, Tamil Nadu, India

### Non-negotiable requirements

1. **Framework**: Use **Astro** (SSG-first).  
2. **CMS**: Use **Decap CMS** (Netlify CMS successor) to manage content stored in the repo (Git-based CMS).  
3. **Hosting**: Deploy on **GitHub Pages** (static hosting only).  
4. **No hard-coded dependency versions**:  
   - Do **not** invent or pin specific version numbers in the narrative.  
   - Use the package manager defaults in generated `package.json` (you may include semver ranges automatically generated by the installer).  
   - Where you need to reference docs, say “use the latest stable versions compatible with Astro and GitHub Pages,” and instruct the build to rely on official package installers.
5. **Compatibility and size constraints**:  
   - Treat GitHub Pages as static hosting with no server runtime.  
   - Keep the repo small and avoid large binary assets; store heavy media (videos/high-res photo galleries) externally (e.g., YouTube/Google Photos/Cloud storage) and embed/stream.  
   - Optimize images (Astro image pipeline where possible) and include guidance to keep images modest in resolution.

### High-level concept and content strategy

The site is a clean, accessible school website emphasizing:
- quick access to **Announcements**
- a **Blog/News** section for longer posts and events coverage
- core institutional pages (About, Academics, Admissions, Facilities, Contact)
- an **Alumni** section with:
  - alumni highlights (profiles)
  - optional “Submit your details” form (static-friendly) OR a mailto fallback if forms aren’t desired

### Pages to implement (sitemap)

Create these pages with a consistent layout, navigation, footer, and SEO metadata:

**Top-level**
- `/` Home
- `/about` About the School
- `/academics` Academics (curriculum, departments, results highlights)
- `/admissions` Admissions (how to apply, documents, fee structure note, contact)
- `/facilities` Facilities (labs, library, sports, transport, etc.)
- `/gallery` Gallery (lightweight; embed external albums and a small curated set of optimized images)
- `/announcements` Announcements index
- `/announcements/[slug]` Announcement detail
- `/blog` Blog index
- `/blog/[slug]` Blog post detail
- `/alumni` Alumni landing
- `/alumni/highlights` Alumni highlights index
- `/alumni/highlights/[slug]` Alumni highlight detail
- `/contact` Contact + map embed + inquiry
- `/privacy` Privacy policy (simple)
- `/404` Not found page

**Header navigation** should include: Home, About, Academics, Admissions, Announcements, Blog, Alumni, Contact.  
**Footer** should include: address, phone/email, quick links, social placeholders.

### Content collections (Astro Content Collections)

Use Astro content collections for:
1. **Announcements**
2. **Blog**
3. **Alumni Highlights** (profiles)

Each collection should be Markdown (or MDX if needed) and support frontmatter like:

**Announcements frontmatter**
- `title`
- `date`
- `category` (e.g., Exam, Holiday, Event, General)
- `pinned` (boolean)
- `summary`
- `coverImage` (optional, but keep small)
- `draft` (boolean)

**Blog frontmatter**
- `title`
- `date`
- `tags` (list)
- `summary`
- `coverImage` (optional)
- `author` (optional)
- `draft` (boolean)

**Alumni Highlights frontmatter**
- `name`
- `graduationYear`
- `currentRole`
- `location` (optional)
- `summary`
- `photo` (optional, prefer small)
- `draft` (boolean)

### Decap CMS requirements

Implement Decap CMS so that school staff can edit content in the browser:

- Host the Decap admin at `/admin/`
- Use **GitHub backend** (Git Gateway is not available on GitHub Pages; do not assume Netlify hosting).
- Configure authentication using **GitHub OAuth app** (describe steps clearly in README):
  - Create GitHub OAuth App
  - Set callback URL to match the deployed GitHub Pages URL
  - Store `client_id` (and any needed config) safely
- If a purely OAuth approach is too complex for the LLM to implement without secrets, provide two options:
  1) GitHub OAuth approach (preferred)
  2) “Editorial workflow via GitHub UI” fallback (not ideal, but include as a contingency)
- Configure collections for:
  - Announcements (stored in `src/content/announcements/`)
  - Blog (stored in `src/content/blog/`)
  - Alumni highlights (stored in `src/content/alumni/`)
- Ensure the CMS supports:
  - creating, editing, deleting entries
  - toggling `draft`
  - image uploads to a small `public/uploads/` folder (warn about size limits and best practices)

### Design requirements

- Mobile-first, accessible, fast.
- Use a simple, clean academic visual identity:
  - light background, strong typography, clear spacing
  - consistent buttons and cards
- Include:
  - home hero section with school name and location
  - “Latest Announcements” (show pinned first, then newest)
  - “From the Blog” section
  - quick links cards (Admissions, Academics, Contact)
- Add RSS for blog if easy.
- Add basic SEO:
  - OpenGraph tags
  - canonical URLs
  - sitemap generation

### Tech stack decisions: Tailwind / shadcn / UI libraries

- **Do NOT use shadcn/ui** (it is React + Tailwind oriented and adds complexity not needed for Astro static).
- TailwindCSS is **optional**:
  - If you use it, keep it minimal and justify it (rapid styling).
  - If you don’t use it, use modern CSS (CSS variables + utility classes you define) to reduce dependencies.
- Avoid heavy UI frameworks. Prefer:
  - Astro components
  - small amount of vanilla JS only when necessary (e.g., mobile menu toggle)

### GitHub Pages deployment requirements

- Use the official GitHub Pages workflow approach:
  - build the Astro site using GitHub Actions
  - deploy `dist/` to Pages
- Configure Astro for Pages:
  - correct `base` path for project pages (`/<repo>/`) OR instruct to use a custom domain
  - generate relative asset paths accordingly
- Include a README with step-by-step instructions for:
  1) local dev
  2) content editing with Decap
  3) deployment to GitHub Pages
  4) adding a custom domain (optional)
  5) keeping repo size small (images guidance)

### Implementation details

#### Home page behavior
- Show:
  - Pinned announcements (max 3)
  - Latest announcements (next 5)
  - Latest blog posts (max 3)
- Add an “All Announcements” and “All Blog Posts” CTA buttons.

#### Announcements index
- Filters by category (client-side simple filter is fine; no external search services).
- Display date, title, summary, category, pinned badge.

#### Blog index
- Tag filtering (simple client-side).
- Blog post pages include:
  - reading time estimate (optional)
  - prev/next navigation

#### Alumni section
- Alumni landing page includes:
  - alumni highlight cards
  - a “Submit your details” link:
    - either a simple static form using a third-party form endpoint (optional)
    - OR a mailto link fallback if you want zero external dependencies
- Keep alumni data minimal and consent-aware.

### Deliverables

Generate:
1. A complete GitHub repository structure with Astro project.
2. All relevant config files (Astro config, content collections, Decap CMS config, GitHub Actions workflow).
3. Example content entries for each collection (2–3 each).
4. A polished README that includes:
   - how to run
   - how to deploy
   - how to configure Decap CMS GitHub backend authentication
   - how to keep within GitHub Pages + repo size constraints

### Output format

- Provide the full file tree first.
- Then output each file content in separate fenced code blocks with the file path as the label.
- Ensure the project builds without placeholders that break builds.
- Use neutral, school-appropriate copywriting and avoid fake claims; keep text generic and editable.

## Notes for the human using this prompt

### Can you have a “backend” with a GitHub Pages static site?
Yes—**but not a traditional server backend on Pages**. For content updates without editing source files, Decap CMS works by committing Markdown files into your GitHub repo. The “backend” is effectively **Git + GitHub API**.

### Do you pay for hosting with Decap CMS?
Decap CMS itself is free and can be served as static files from GitHub Pages. You generally **do not pay for hosting** if you use GitHub Pages. The main operational requirement is configuring authentication (GitHub OAuth app) so editors can log in and write content.

### Asset size + repo limits
GitHub repositories have practical size limits. Keep uploads small:
- prefer ~1920px max width images
- compress JPG/WEBP
- embed videos externally
